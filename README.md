## About the bank

Does not allow clients to pay off their loans with a credit card (we like to promote better financial decisions)

Tellers can only work at one location

We only allow deposits into accounts at locations that have a teller working there. 

Tellers can be both employees and customers. 

## Useful Files

### DDL.sql
Resets all of the tables, dropping the old versions and inserting the new ones. 

### DataGenerator.java
Fills the table with semi-random data. All the names are predetermined however any number value is randomly determined.
